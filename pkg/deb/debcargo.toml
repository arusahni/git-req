# - crate B's default-feature depends on crate A's no-default-features (which has no dependencies)
#
# In these cases, you'll need to (for example) add "librustA+B-dev <!nocheck>"
# to build_depends_excludes in A's debcargo.toml to break the cycle, and also
# add override_dh_auto_test to A's d/rules to avoid selecting the B feature
# when running the test build. Depending on the exact situation, it should be
# sufficient to do this override only for one of the packages in the cycle.

# express the dependencies; these ought not to have cycles in anyway, even in
